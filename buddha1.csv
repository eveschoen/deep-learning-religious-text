dn1:1.3.1,"Then several mendicants rose at the crack of dawn and sat together in the pavilion, where the topic of evaluation came up: ","saṅkhiyadhamma is a unique term, occurring, so far as I can tell, nowhere else in the Pali literature. The commentary glosses as kathadhamma, and thus Bodhi and Thanissaro effectively just have it as 'conversation'. Rhys Davids followed by Wals have something like 'trend of conversation.' Yet it seems to me that such a unique term in such a prominent position should have a more specific maning. I am not aware of elsewhere in the ENTs where sankya has the plain sense 'conversation'. rather, it is connected with the notion of evaluation, measuring. Here the subject of discussion is the different ways the two parties evaluate the Sangha.",1:1.3.1,1,1,3,1,0

This phrase only occurs elsewhere at MN 138, where we have “āyatiṁ jātijarāmaraṇadukkhasamudayasambhavo na hoti”. There, in his later rendering, BB has “origination of suffering—of birth, ageing, and death in the future”. Thus he maintains a rendering that essentially collapses the synonyms. RD has “be manifested that concatenation of rebirth, old age, death and the uprising of Ill”. MW has “an arising and coming to be”. Thanissaro has “coming-into-play of the origination”. Now, dukkhasamudaya occurs a couple hundred times elsewhere, invariably in the sense “origin of suffering”. I think we should take it here in the same sense, which would agree with the syntax of RD’s rendering. Comm has “Dukkhasamudayasambhavoti dukkharāsisambhavo”, which at least suggests that dukkhasamudaya is to some degree separate from the rest. At MN 138 it is “Jātijarāmaraṇadukkhasamudayasambhavoti jātijarāmaraṇassa ceva avasesassa ca dukkhassa nibbatti na hotīti attho”. Here, nibbatti applies equally to jati, etc. and dukkha.

","ettāvatā vaṭṭaṁ vattati itthattaṁ paññāpanāya is tricky. Thanissaro has “the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting (discernibility) of this world”. This is tempting, but elsewhere pannapanaya is as expected governed by the genitive in such constructions, eg rūpakkhandhassa paññāpanāya. BB here follows comm “namapannati”. But this phrase must surely be translated with eg SN 22.56 “Ye kevalino vaṭṭaṁ tesaṁ natthi paññāpanāya.” “For consummate ones, there is no cycle of rebirths to be found.” There BB has “there is no round for describing them”. At MN 22 he has “there is no [future] round for manifestation”. By his comment on SN 22.56 he is more or less agnostic on these readings.

Walshe more poetically has “To roam the realm of wisdom’s law”. Neither of these agree with comm, which has “Padesavattīti padese vipassanāmagge pavattanto”.

Thus, “I have been the teacher who points out the noble teaching.” While disagreeing in details, this agrees with the thrust of the comm, in that it is to do with teaching.

But in PED sandāna is defined as “cord, tether, fetter.””. At SN 22.96 he has “tethers of fine jute”. However, jute is a coarse cloth and can hardly be meant here. Skt dictionaries consistently say “Woven silk, silk-garment, a very fine garment in general”, which fits with our context. The only commentarial gloss I can find for this is that on SN 22.96, which says “Dukūlasandānānīti dukūlasantharāni”. But this yields the sense, “cover or mat”, which may be right, but is less than convincing.

Taken literally, ekanta could mean “of one aim”. This would then be a slightly different question: “(though we know that they appear different, nevertheless) is the end result of spiritual practice the same?” It seems comm has this in mind at least for the first term, but it is unclear to me whether it intended this analysis to be applied to each term: “Ekantavādāti ekoyeva anto vādassa etesaṁ, na dvedhā gatavādāti ekantavādā, ekaññeva vadantīti pucchati.

However, I think it is more likely connected with santānaka in the next line, in the sense of “networks” or tendrils appearing in the water, a clear enough description of curdling. This is supported by the Sanskrit at SF 277, which has “saṁmūrcchitaḥ saṁtanoti tadyathā pakvasya kṣīrasya śaraḥ saṁmūrcchitaḥ saṁtanoty” Sammucchati, which is absent from the Pali, I think clarifies the meaning. It is also found at Mu-Kd 17. Rasapathavi is also obscure, and nowhere, i think, explained in comms. At SN 5.9 we have pathavirasa in the sense “nutriments in soil”. SF 277 and Mu-Kd 17 also have pṛthivīrasa, so we probably should take the exact form too literally. RD and MW translate “savoury earth” which is not satisfactory.
